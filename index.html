                    <h1> 1. Life in Rwanda </h1>
                    <h2>Houses and life in general</h2>
                    <p>My family and I moved to Rwanda in 1997
                       from the Congo. We fled Congo because of
                       conflicts and we had to go to Rwanda where 
                       we lived in a refugee camp for 17 years.
                       Life was not easy in the refugee camp, there 
                       was no running water and no electricity.
                       We were living off of 24 cents a day from the
                       UN. We were living in small houses.The photo below shows
                       some of the houses in the camp. The roofs of these houses
                       were plastic sheetings.

                    <h2>Education in the camp</h2>
                    <p>The education in the camp was run by an NGO that was 
                        helping to pay for all the kids to go school. This NGO paid 
                        only up to 9th grade and past 9th there was no help.
                        It was hard for parents and the kids to see kids dropping out 
                        of school because they could not afford to pay for it.
                    </P>

                    <h1>2. Coming to the USA</h1>
                    <p> No one in my family ever thought we would ever come to the US.
                        Our hope was that one day we would go back to our home country in the Congo,
                        but as the time went on, Congo became more unsecured. The UN had a program to
                        resettle refugees in the US, but we never thought we would be lucky nough to be 
                        one of the families that would be selected to move to US. The vetting process
                        would take like 2 years or more. By surprise, we were called that we had 4 dyas to get
                        ready to move. We were so excited. we said bye to our relatives and we packed
                        and we moved here.

                    </P>
